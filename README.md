Saying hello to all the adventures out there, to the ones who can‚Äôt live their days without getting a whiff of fresh air; saying hello to our future users which, we hope, will find our service useful for their adventures; saying hello also to the ones who will be there to correct us, you will help us to grow up faster.

Saying hello to WeClimb.it, with which we aim to aggregate sparse data and normalize them ‚Ä¶ because the information is beautiful (and useful) only when well organized :-)

WeClimb.it was started years ago, it was 2013. Since then at least three versions of the platform have been released.

Now it is time to share the hard work with the rest of the community. WeClimb.it goes open source!
